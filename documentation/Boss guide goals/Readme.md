# In this folder we describe the core features of the app
How should each boss be described in the database
How each boss attack should be looking in the database

## The main goal of the app
- Show how to dodge every boss attack (or at least the main bosses at first)
- Show opening for player to attack bosses
- All of that should be shown with gifs or maybe short videos? But gifs could be easier to implement
